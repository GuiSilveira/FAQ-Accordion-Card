## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about absolute positioning, animations and how to keep the layout responsive.

### Continued development

My wish is to keep learning more about the mobile-first workflow because I really enjoyed it and it feels much more easy to scale up to desktop.

### Useful resources

- [Text Animations](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/css-text-animations/) - This gave me the ideas i wanted to make the animations on the text.
